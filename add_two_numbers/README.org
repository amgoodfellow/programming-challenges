#+TITLE: Add Two Problem
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Problem Introduction
This is a problem from [[https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/][leet code]], which is a really cool website! In fact, it might be nice to use
their site while attempting this problem because of their integrated test-cases. Fair warning 
though, I don't like their custom data-structures. I'd rather they just used the language default 
list structure.

** Description
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are 
stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and
return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
