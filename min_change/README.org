#+TITLE: Min Change

* Problem Introduction
This is a variation of an interview question once asked of [[https://github.com/amgoodfellow][@amgoodfellow]]

As an article on [[geeksforgeeks][https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/]] phrases this question:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have infinite supply of each of 
~C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm}~ valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change?
#+END_QUOTE

#+begin_src 
Input: coins[] = {25, 10, 5, 1}, V = 30
Output: Minimum 2 coins required
#+end_src

So, in other words, given an array of coin denominations (of natural numbers with at least one 1), 
and a natural number V, output the minimum number of coins we can use to get to value V.

** Example Input / Output

| Input              | Output |
|--------------------+--------|
| 30, [25, 10, 5, 1] |      2 |
| 55, [50, 20, 1]    |      6 |
| 63, [50, 20, 1]    |      6 |
