#+TITLE: ASCII Mapping
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Problem Introduction
This is a logic/programming problem from [[https://github.com/nickwoodle][@nickwoodle]]. Given a series of string inputs, and a series
of floating point outputs, find the mapping between the two. Then, write an algorithm for the 
mapping.

** Input / Output

| Input       |  Output |
|-------------+---------|
| Hello       |     100 |
| Test        |     104 |
| QWERTY      |      82 |
| !@#$%^&     | 48.1428 |
| This is fun | 87.8333 |

So far this person has submitted two solutions, one in Rust and one in Common Lisp

*** Rust
#+INCLUDE: "./amgoodfellow.rs" src rust :lines "1-5"

Comments:

There's probably a better way to handle all the casting that I'm doing, but this seems to pass all
the necessary test cases.

*** Common Lisp
#+INCLUDE: "./amgoodfellow.lisp" src lisp

Comments:

Again, I'm sure there's a better, more concise way to do all this, but. This is what I'm able to do
right now
